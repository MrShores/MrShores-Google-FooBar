# MrShores-Google-FooBar

My python solutions to the first ~3 levels of [Google's FooBar challenge](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/google-foobar-how-searching-web-earned-software-graduate-job-google-1517284).

Written in python with iPython Notebooks.

I would love to continue the progress, but turns out working + eating + sleeping severely limit my time.
